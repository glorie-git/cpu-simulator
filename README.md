# cpu-simulator

This was a school project.

The code runs but does not work 100%

SHORT DDESCRIPTION AS PER INSTRUCTOR DESCRIPTION

Fully functional C++ CPU simulator that executes appropriately binary-formatted programs. 
The CPU supports flexible hardware structures and program parameters, may run in debug or execution mode, 
and provides performance statistics on executed programs. The simulator will be coded and realized using various 
classes and structures in C++’s Standard Template Library (STL).

An instruction which enters a CPU is processed incrementally in a series of steps. All instructions are assigned a number, or ID, as they enter the CPU. Our CPU is an in-order processor, meaning that instructions must be processed in the order which they enter the CPU. Therefore instructions must be identified using a numbering system to process instructions in-order; the younger the instruction, the greater the instruction’s ID value. The series of steps required to execute an instruction is referred to as a pipeline. Since each instruction is divided and processed in a series of steps, several successive instructions may overlap in the pipeline at a given time.
